### Welcome to my GitHub Profile

Hello! I am a Web and Visual Motion Designer with expertise in Wordpress. Currently, I am taking on the challenge of becoming a Full Stack Developer at CODECOOL.

## My Skills

As a Full Stack Developer, I am currently focusing on learning Python and have plans to expand my knowledge to other technologies such as C#, .NET, and Java throughout my course at CODECOOL. Additionally, my experience as a Web and Visual Motion Designer has given me strong design skills and a keen eye for detail, which I can bring to the table when developing web applications.

In addition to my design and front-end development skills, I also have experience working with ERP systems such as Soneta Enova and Comarch Optima. This experience has provided me with a strong understanding of business processes and how technology can be used to support and streamline them.

## Contributions

I am actively involved in open-source development and enjoy contributing to projects that interest me. Some of the projects I have contributed to include:

    An e-commerce website built using Woocomerce.
    A blogging platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.

You can find my personal portfolio and all my projects at www.adrianlistwan.com. It provides a detailed overview of my skills, experience, and projects.

Thank you for visiting my profile! I hope you find it informative and interesting. Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to say hello.
